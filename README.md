# PseudocodeEditor
A simple editor for editing and running pseudocodes. Python installation is required.

# How To Use
Install python, download our latest release (.py) and run the py file. Then u can code
seamlessly. Only support files in the .pseudo format. You can use this to create 
.pseudo files. 

# How to Run
Tap "Program" on the menubar and tap "Run". The output would be shown at the console behind the window.

# Syntax
Output(): Output the lines \
Input(): Ask the user to input \
Logical functions: similar to python but there is no
elif, we use "else if" instead. \
Assigning values to variables: <- instead of =

# Special Loops
Repeat-until loop: 
```
repeat
  #your actions here
  until (condition):
    End loop #not break
```
